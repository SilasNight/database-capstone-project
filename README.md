Capstone project for HyperionDev bootcamp. 
This is my own project
If you are in this bootcamp as well I recommend you don't copy paste any of this. 

This is how I did my capstone project for the database portion. 
I can't see how this would be helpful to someone other than serious edge cases. This is just a homework project. 

I am the only person to have worked on this project. I take a lot of insperation from the layout of my previous assinments and
have reused many useful functions that I enjoy using in CLI's

This project is used to keep track of many different books with the aid of a database.
